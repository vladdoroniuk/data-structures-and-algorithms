# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

The repository contains my own implementations of various data structures and algorithms (DSA) in [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript).

## Overview

Each DSA resides in its own folder with the following structure:

```
dsa-name
â”œâ”€ dsa-name.ts
â”œâ”€ dsa-name.test.ts
â””â”€ README.md

kebab case looks pretty decent ðŸ¤”
```

Some algorithms may have several implementations in a single `.ts` file, usually these are optimized versions. You can also read a brief description of a DSA in a `README` and run test cases specified in a `.test.ts` file, see more in [Testing](#testing).

## List of implemented DSA

The list is occasionally updated.

### Data Structures

- Trees
  - [Binary tree](./binary-tree/) (todo)
  - [B-tree](./b-tree/) (todo)
- Linear data structures
  - [Linked list](./linked-list/) (todo)
  - [Doubly linked list](./doubly-linked-list/) (todo)

### Algorithms

- Sorting
  - [Bubble sort](./bubble-sort/)
  - [Quicksort](./quicksort/) (todo)
- Sets
  - [Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle](./fisher-yates-shuffle/) (todo)
  - [Knapsack problem](./knapsack-problem/) (todo)

## Testing

The repository uses [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for package management and [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest) for testing, so setup is quite fast.

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn test`

Perhaps I should add links to books, articles and scientific papers here ðŸ¤·
